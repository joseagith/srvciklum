## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains Python modules to build an intelligent agent that can:
- Ingest and chunk documents for semantic search
- Search guidelines using a vector store (e.g., Qdrant)
- Drive agentic reasoning with Azure OpenAI language models
- Support insurance-specific workflows and classification logic

Currently this repo includes:
- **Document ingestion scripts**
- **Guideline search interface**
- **Agentic decision logic**
- Core utilities for working with OpenAI & embeddings

Python 100% — ready to integrate into apps, APIs, or pipelines. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
